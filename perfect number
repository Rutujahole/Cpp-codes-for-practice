Number is Perfect or not:
 Note:- Perfect number is the number whose sum of divisors will be a perfect number. For example : 6 divisors are 1,2,3,6.
But 6 number itself cannot be considered a divisor. Therefore, the divisors are 1,2,3. The addition of these 3 nos is 6. And it is equal to the number to which we are finding divisors for.
Pseudo code:
Start.
Declare variables. Num for user number, i for iteration, and initialize sum=0.(note:nsum is to be initialized in order not to receive garbage value at the end of program).
Take the input number “num” from the user.
Start the for loop for (i=0;1<num;i++)
Check for the condition if(num % i==0)
If true sum=sum+i if not come out of loop.
Check condition if(sum == num) return number is perfect else return not the perfect number

Program:
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num,i,sum=0;
    cout<<"Enter te number\n";
    cin>>num;
    for(i=1;i<num;i++)
    {
        if(num % i == 0)
        {
          sum=sum+i;
        }
    }
    if(sum == num)
     cout<<"the number "<<num<<" is perfect number\n"<<endl;
    else
      cout<<"the number "<<num<<" is not perfect number\n"<<endl;
    

    return 0;
}
